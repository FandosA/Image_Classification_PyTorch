# Image classification with PyTorch
This is a simple convolutional neural network to classify images with PyTorch. The model has been designed to classify images using the Intel Image Classification dataset, which can be found in Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification).
