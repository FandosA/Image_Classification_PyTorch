# Image classification with PyTorch
This is a simple convolutional neural network to classify images with PyTorch. The model has been designed to classify images using the Intel Image Classification dataset, which can be found in Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification). This dataset contains around 25k images (around 14k images in the Training Set, 3k in Test Set and 7k in the Prediction Set) of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories:

- buildings → 0,
- forest → 1,
- glacier → 2,
- mountain → 3,
- sea → 4,
- street → 5
